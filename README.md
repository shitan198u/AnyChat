## Configuration

- Rename the `secrets_example.toml` file to `secrets.toml` in the `src/anychat/.streamlit/` directory.

## Ollama Installation

To use Ollama for AnyChat, you need to install Ollama and download the necessary models. Follow the instructions below:

1. **Install Ollama:**

Visit the official Ollama website for installation instructions: [Ollama Download](https://ollama.com/download)

2. **Download Ollama Models:**

Open your terminal and run the following commands to download the required models:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

This command downloads the `nomic-embed-text` model, which is necessary for running Ollama embeddings.

```bash
ollama pull openchat
```

This command downloads the `openchat` model, which you can use as a language model in AnyChat.

## Usage

1. **Set API Keys:**
- If you're using Google Gemini or Groq, obtain the necessary API keys and store them securely in the `src/anychat/.streamlit/secrets.toml` file.

2. **Run the Application:**

## Additional Notes

- For optimal performance, ensure you have the necessary resources (CPU, RAM) to handle the document processing and LLM computations.
- The chatbot's accuracy and responsiveness may vary depending on the complexity of your documents and the chosen LLM.
- Consider using a GPU-enabled environment if you have access to one, as it can significantly speed up the processing.
